### Test your typing speed and train until you’ve fully harnessed your mind, body, and keyboard!

### Peck is a simple, minimal speed typing test designed to be both a skill-building tool and a competitive game. Enjoy racing on tens of thousands of unique quotes from pop culture, historic moments, or maybe even a familiar book. Get visual and tactile feedback to minimize your corrective reaction time. Practice day and night with the comfort of a pitch-back dark mode. Build your confidence up until you're so fast that you’re flying like a modern day screen-addicted teen!

### How it works? 
- Press the big button to jump into a race! You’ll be greeted with a random quote. 
- As you type out the quote, characters will turn red or green as a visual indication of your correctness. If you make a mistake, go back and fix it!
- Performance is scored by WPM (words per minute), accuracy, and total time, all of which are update live throughout the race.
- Keep trying to up your score before throwing down the gauntlet by sharing your race results with a friend.
